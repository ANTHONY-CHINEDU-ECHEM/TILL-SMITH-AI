"""Instruction tuning export.

Turns the incident base into supervised fine tuning data in the chat messages
JSONL format. Two record types are produced:

grounded
    The user turn is a full evidence pack and the assistant turn is the verified
    extractive answer, teaching any open model to answer strictly from retrieved
    evidence with correct citations.
case
    The user turn describes one incident and the assistant turn gives the
    documented fix, result and lesson, distilling the incident base itself.
